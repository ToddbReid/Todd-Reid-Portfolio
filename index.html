            <p>
                My name is Todd Reid, I currently live in New Jersey and work at a dealership painting cars. I graduated highschool with certifications for painting and refinishing and have spent the last 5 years making my way up to painting cars all the way from being a detailer.
                If I'm not at home playing games on my computer I am out with my friends or working on my car at home. One of my biggest passions is modified cars, ever since I was young I loved going to car shows and playing with model cars.
                The other thing I've always done since I was young was sit in front of the tv and play games, nothing has changed now that I'm an adult but I no longer sit in front of a tv but instead sit in front of a computer monitor.
                I decided to take the coding bootcamp through Rutgers because I figured out that painting cars wasn't all I thought it was going to be, I really don't like the strain it puts on my body. I figured since I know my way around a pc, why not use some of that knowledge and learn to code.
